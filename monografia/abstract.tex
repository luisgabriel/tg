The multicore processors are present in almost every modern computer, including mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. However, only a small portion of the processing power provided by the multiple cores are actually used by the applications due the difficulty of writing concurrent systems. Aiming to make the development of this kind of system become more tangible, some new synchronization mecanisms are being proposed in functional programming languages. Functional programming emphasizes a programming style based on pure functions and immutable data which makes the development of concurrent programs easier. The aim of this project is to make a comparative study of the functional languages Clojure and Haskell focusing on the use of Sotfware Transacional Memory. To this end, the implementation of a parallel search engine was used as object of study.
